## **The Creed of a Python Renaming Tool**

1. **This is my renaming tool. There are many like it, but this one is mine.**  

2. **My renaming tool is my best friend. It is my workflow. I must master it as I must master my craft.**  

3. **My renaming tool, without me, is useless. Without my renaming tool, I am slow. I must execute my scripts cleanly. I must rename more efficiently than chaos threatens to disorganize me. I must structure my files before confusion spreads. I will...**  

4. **My renaming tool and I know that what counts in this battle is not the number of lines of code, nor the verbosity of output, nor the complexity of syntax. We know that only precision matters. We will rename with precision…**  

5. **My renaming tool is an extension of myself, even as I am of it. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will know its weaknesses, its strengths, its functions, its arguments, its regex patterns, and its logging behavior. I will guard it against poor error handling and unnecessary inefficiencies, just as I guard my system against corruption and failure. I will keep it optimized and robust. We will become part of each other. We will…**  

6. **Before logic and order, I swear this creed. My renaming tool and I are the guardians of organization. We are the masters of disorder. We are the saviors of structure.**  

7. **So be it, until all filenames are clean, every directory is in order, and there is no chaos—only clarity!**
